Then, all of a sudden, we stopped dancing. You know? Grunge came in, we dressed in plaid and oversized jeans. Then, later on, kids wore trench coats and shot each other in school, and that's not cool. But guess what. Guess what's going on in the high school now. Kids are dancing again. Organized choreographed dance. They're doing organized choreographed dances to solve their problems. They also give each other blow jobs. They got these things called rainbow parties.
